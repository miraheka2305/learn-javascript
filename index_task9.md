# Day 9 Task : REST API Implementation

## Instructions
1. Open your last task javascript file.
2. Create HTML file that has table in it
    * The table consists of: Rank, Name, Score, Poster
3. Create 2 buttons:
    * First button will populate table from API
    * Second button will clear the table
4. Style the table as you want. Note: make it more readable than plain html.

## Example Result
![example result](./example.gif "result example")

## Notes
Modern javascript syntax usage (such as `const`, `map`, arrow function, etc) is encourage for this task, as that'll help so much on data manipulation.
